# The Reddit Reader
The Reddit is an American social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. Reddit's registered community members can submit content such as text posts or direct links. They can also give comments and upvote and downvote a content. The “Reddit Reader” created for EaseCentral is a simple application running on Android platform. Users can create an account with a username and password. They will register with this app only, not with official Reddit application. Once they have an account, users will go to a page and view Reddit posts and be able to favorite links/posts they like and come back to a different page to view their "favorite" posts. </br>
